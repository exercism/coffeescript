# ignore

## CoffeeScript specific instructions

A BinarySearchTree instance must have 3 properties: `data`, `left` and `right`.

An instance must have these methods:

* `insert` which adds a new piece of data to the tree. This will add a new "leaf" node somewhere in the tree.
* `each` that takes a "callback" argument. That is a function that will be called on _each piece of data_ in the tree **in order**.

This exercise is a great place to practice **recursion**.
