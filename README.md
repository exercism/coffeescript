Please see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/exercism/x-api/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-exercise-data)


### CoffeeScript icon
We were unable to find a license for the CoffeeScript logo, however we believe that it is owned by Jeremy Ashkenas, who holds the copyright on the CoffeeScript language.
We are using the logo to identify the CoffeeScript language itself, not any part of Exercism, which we believe to be admissible under fair use.
The version of the logo that we are using is a black/white adaptation of the logo found on coffeescript.org.
